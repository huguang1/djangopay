used third-party payment methods such as Alipay, WeChat, etc. in the backend. When users submit payment requests on the platform, the platform integrates user information and requests the third-party platform. Then, the third-party payment methods are displayed on the platform, and the transaction is completed once the payment is successfully notified by the third-party. The system is primarily built using the Tornado asynchronous framework, with simple rate limiting strategy and IP blacklist using Redis to prevent attacks. Redis and MySQL are used for master-slave replication and read-write separation, while Nginx is used for load balancing. Token is used to ensure API security, and Vue and Layui are used for the frontend implementation.
